This project served as a test of accuracy of the unity physics engine. 
These files create a newtonian gravity simulation.
Using two bodys where Mass_1 >> Mass_2 a stable orbit can be simulated.
Initalizing Body_1 on the origin and Body_2 on the x axis with a y velocity component, a eliptical orbit is achieved.
The script outputs the time that Body_2 crosses the x axis.

Using the inital values, and the data collected we can compare the results with Keplers 3rd law of Planatary Motion.
Period^2 = (4 * pi^2) / (GravityConstant * (Mass_1 + Mass_2))*(semi-major axis)
Where,
GravityConstant  = 1e-4
Mass_1            = 1e9
Mass_2            = 1e6
semiMajorAxis     = 144.75 / 2

The Period was calculated to be 12.228s
Unity calculated                12.3s
Representing a 0.591% error
